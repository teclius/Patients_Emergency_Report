# Patients Emergency Room Visit Report
The primary objective of the Power BI project titled "Patients Emergency Room Visit Report" was to analyze and visualize key metrics related to patients' emergency room visits. The project aimed to provide actionable insights for healthcare administrators and practitioners to optimize patient care and resource allocation.

## Key Focus Areas:

### Evaluating Average Waiting Time of Patients: 
Here i Calculated the average waiting time for patients in the emergency room to identify potential bottlenecks in the triage process.

### Patients Visits on a Monthly Basis: 
I Analyzed the trend of patient visits on a monthly basis to understand seasonal variations and demand patterns.

### Total Visits by Department Referral: 
Here i examined the distribution of patient visits based on department referrals to allocate resources efficiently and streamline workflows.

### Determining Average Wait Time by Age Group: 
I also analyzed the average wait time experienced by patients across different age groups to identify demographic-specific trends and improve service delivery.

### Determining Average Satisfaction by Age Group and Patient Race: 
I investigated patient satisfaction levels based on age group and race to address potential disparities and enhance the overall patient experience.

### Determining Average Wait Time by Age Group and Patient Race: 
Finally I explored the relationship between wait times, age groups, and patient races to identify any disparities and implement strategies for equitable care delivery.
